## What is it?

This is a simple local web app that allows you to create "micro-notes" of different classifications, currently:

- url
- code
- text
- cmd

You can also call a list of inbuilt functions that do things developers may typicallt do, currently this list is small:

- `> tB64` This will convert the string that follows to Base 64
- `> fB64` This will convert the string that follows from Base 64 (assuming it's a valid base 64 encoded string)
- `> guid` This will generate a guid for you
